# The Color Game
Let's play the great color guessing game!

# Project Overview

This is my first interactive web game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**. The goal of this project is to familiar 
myself with a range of **DOM** manipulations as well as to further develop my UI design skills. To win the game, the player 
will have to guess correctly the color square based on a randomly generated **RGB** value. 
There are currently two levels of difficulty and my code makes it very easy to add more levels in the future.
The below GIF shows the basicgame flow.

# Language
